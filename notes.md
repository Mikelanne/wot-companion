GOALS:

This app is a spoiler free WoT companion. This means the user inputs ALL the information themselves. Most companions are filled with spoilers. I saw a HUGE spoiler when looking up a character during my first or second book - that sucked. All information will be user specific.
This means all charactesr, groups, and locations need to belong to a user.

CURRENT NOTES AND TO DO
[] Only able to click on "user dashboard" when user is logged in // only visible when User is Logged in (maybe remove Nav bar from homepage)
[] Move the sign up and login forms to their own page????? Might not matter that much actually.
[] when the user logs in and is redirected to dashboard, the username doesn't appear until you refresh the page.
[] conditional rendering for the user dashboard in the navbar worked at first but once you moved pages, it went away. Not staying quite right. This is what a store is for typically.
